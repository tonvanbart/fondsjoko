Archive of a site (Dutch) I made for my brother in law when he got seriously ill. He was editor of several motorcycle magazines, and riders from the Netherlands and Belgium came together

Found the files on my old PC and decided to revive the site on Github Pages. See [https://tonvanbart.github.io/fondsjoko/](https://tonvanbart.github.io/fondsjoko/).
