Archive of a site (Dutch) I made for my brother in law when he got seriously ill. He was editor of several motorcycle magazines, and riders from the Netherlands and Belgium came together 
to raise money for (experimental) treatment in Austria. After he passed, I turned the site into an "in memoriam" page.

Found the files on my old PC and decided to revive the site on Github Pages. See [https://tonvanbart.github.io/fondsjoko/](https://tonvanbart.github.io/fondsjoko/).
